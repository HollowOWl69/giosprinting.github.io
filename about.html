      <p id="rcorners2">Gio's Printing Services, is located at Barangay 54 824 C Tayuman Street Tondo Manila. It was established in 2009 by Mr. Jessie "Dodoy" de Jesus. From the beginning, the company's primary products were printing services and photocopy. The business quickly gained a reputation for quality work and excellent customer service, which helped it establish a loyal customer base. As the business grew, the company moved from its old location in barangay 156 to its current larger place in barangay 56 (where their still at currently) to better accommodate its customers' needs. This was a major turning point for Gio's Printing Services, as it allowed the company to expand its services and take on more clients. The move also helped to improve the company's visibility in the local community. In 2020, Gio's Printing Services was passed down to Mr. Christian Jay B. de Jesus, who has since led the company with a focus on innovation and customer satisfaction. The business continues to evolve by adopting new technologies and expanding its services, maintaining its reputation as a trusted provider of high-quality printing services and a leader in the local business community.</p>
